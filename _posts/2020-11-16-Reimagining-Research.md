# Reimagining Research

### Identify a statistical question that you could ask.
    The world where my experiment exists is a world in which this bird technology evolves to the point where they can be used as drones. These drones could have cameras attached to them that could be police people in cities. My statistical question would be, "How do bird drones affect crime rates in a city?"

### Identify the population you would study to answer the question. What information about the population would help answer your question?
    The population for this experiment is a weird one. My population would be all the cities in the United States. The information I would want is the current crime rate in the city as well as crime rates from the same time a year ago. 

### Identify a feasible sample frame, and explain your reasoning.
    I would only use one city, New York. I think using more than one city wouldn’t be feasible. Every different city we set up an operation in would cost an exponential amount of money. I would choose New York City because it has the most people in the United States and therefore would give me the most amount of data. While New York City will require the most bird drones as it is the biggest city in the U.S, I feel like doing two cities will still cost a lot more than just doing one, making two cities completely unrealistic.  I didn’t want to pick a city that was riddled with crime or a city without crime because I wanted the data I collected from the city to represent the average city in the U.S. I do understand that New York City doesn’t completely represent every city in the U.S, but I think to keep the experiment “feasible”, I believe for those reasons I would choose New York City. We could also divide the data between the boroughs, looking at the data from a borough perspective could more closely represent a specific city in the U.S.

### Identify the sampling method you would use, and explain your reasoning. What makes this method better than the others?
    To keep the experiment feasible, we have to do strict quota sampling. Using one city was what I deemed feasible, so I can’t leave this city up to chance. This city has to be able to represent every city in the entire country to a degree so I can’t leave it up to probability. I have to hand pick the best city for the data from the experiment to actually be useful. I understand the risk of allowing me to choose the city as I clearly have some bias as I am choosing the city I live in, but to balance the feasibility and success of the experiment, I believe I have to choose the subject that I deem best to fulfill this. For the reason I layed out earlier, I believe New York City is the best choice

### Suppose you had the means to run an experiment on this sample. Identify the null and alternative hypotheses.
    The null hypothesis is that bird drones have no effect on the crime rate in a given city. I see two alternative hypotheses. Either, bird drones reduce crime but not significantly enough to make up for the cost of the bird drones. Or, bird drones reduce crime in a cost effective way relative to how much they reduce crime.
