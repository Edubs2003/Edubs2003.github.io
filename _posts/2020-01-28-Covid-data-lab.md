# Covid Lab

### Which dataset did you work with?

I used the Covid Data set.

### Discuss your analysis of the dataset. You are encouraged to use DataFrames and other Python libraries! Include details such as: The variables you looked at, Distributions of variables (center and variability), Relationships between variables, Visualizations of the dataset

I used a bar graph to visualize the dataset. This bar graph shows all countries with more than 2,000,000 total vaccinations. On the x-axis are all the countries that fit this description, while the y-axis represents the number of vaccinations per country. The bar graph goes up by a factor of 0.2 x 10^7 on the y axis while every country represented is above 0.2 x 10^7 total vaccinations. The mode, the country with the highest amount of vaccinations, is the United States, with China at a close second. The United Kingdom is a distant third, with China and the United States having more than double the number of total vaccinations. The table then shows England in fourth; however, England is part of the United Kingdom, so we can ignore that. Israel and U.A.E round out the top 5, respectively. The data set range is over 0.7 x 10^7, which the massive difference between the leading countries (in this case, the U.S and China) versus countries that are still in the top 5 in total vaccination distribution. We also see this same thing from the median, which is the U.K. The difference between the U.K and China (the second highest country) compared to the difference between Israel shows this same idea. If we ordered the graph from least to greatest going left to right, we would see a high peak with the U.S and China; however, the data would scew to the right aggressively. The mode is around 1.0 x 10^7 and the median is 0.5 x 10^7. The graph right now is order of the first letter of the country, so it looks bimodal.

I made a second bar graph to visualize another aspect of the data. This bar graph shows all countries with a ratio of 9 vaccinated people out of every 100 people in their country. The x-axis has all the countries that fit this description, while the y-axis represents the ratio of vaccinated people to the countries total population. The bar graph goes up by 5 with every country in the graph being above 9. The mode, the country with the highest ratio of vaccinated people, is Israel. Gibraltar is a very close second, both having over 20 vaccinated people per 100. The U.A.E is a pretty distant third, followed by Seychelles and United Kingdom. The data set range is over 10, which shows the massive difference between the top countries (Israel and Gibraltar) compared to countries that are still in the top 5 as the United Kingdom. Israel has doubled the number of vaccinated people than the United Kingdom. The median shows this same idea, with the U.A.E being the median. The difference between Gibraltar and the U.A.E compared to Seychelles shows this same idea. If we ordered the graph from least to greatest going left to right, we would see a high peak with Israel and Gibralter; however, the data wouold scew to the right. The mode is around 20 while the median is around 16. The scew to the right would not be as aggressive comapred to the first bar graph.

### What conclusions can you draw about this dataset? What is your supporting evidence?

I can conclude that Israel, the United Kingdom, and the U.A.E are handling vaccine disruption better than most, if not all, of the countries in the world. Looking at my first dataset, we see that the United Kingdom, Israel, and the U.A.E are all in the top five for total vaccination disruption. However, they are significantly behind countries like the U.S and China. Yet, China and the U.S have the first and third biggest population in the world, respectively. So while they are giving out more vaccinates, they have more people who need vaccines. Looking at the second data set, which depicts the ratio of vaccinated people per 100 people in the country, we see Israel, the United Kingdom, and the U.A.E all in the top 5, while countries like China and the United States are nowhere to be found. We also see Gibraltar and Seychelles in the top 5 of this second data set; however, this is misleading because of these countries' populations. The U.K has a population of over 66 million people; Israel has a population of over 9 million, and the U.A.E has a population of 9.7 million. This is compared to Gibraltar and Seychelles having 33,700 and 97,000 people. While they have a good ratio, it is because their populations are minimal. The United Kingdom, Israel, and U.A.E all have massive populations compared to Gibraltar and Seychelles while also having a better ratio of vaccinated people than the United States and China. This leads me to believe that these countries are dealing with vaccine distribution better than any other country in the world. Out of these three countries, it is debatable which is the best depending on what you prefer. Out of these three countries, the U.K has the highest total disruptions but has a worse ratio than Israel. The U.A.E. Israel has the best ratio but has a lower disruption than the U.K. The U.A.E has the second-best ratio but is last in total vaccinations. The U.K also has over six times as many people as both then Israel and the U.A.E. While I would say the U.K is dealing with it the best because they have a good ratio while also having to deal with a massive population (which makes it harder to maintain that ratio), you could as easily argue for Israel who has a significant population while having the best ratio in the world.
