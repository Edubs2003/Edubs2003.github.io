# My Prior Experiences in Computer Science

Hi, my name is Ethan, and I don't have that much pior computer science experience til last year. Last year I took CS 2 (without even talking CS 1). That was the first time I had ever coded before in my life. After a year of learning java and a little bit of python, I also took a week long class over the summer talking about python and data analysis, but it wasn't that good especially since it was online. ![Computer](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2018/09/27/09/22/web-3706562__340.jpg)
